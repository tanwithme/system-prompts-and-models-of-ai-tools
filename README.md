# TanOS: Your Personalized AI Co-Pilot

Welcome to TanOS! This isn't just another app; it's envisioned as your personal AI co-pilot, "Nomad." Think of it as an operating system for your life, designed to help you navigate everything with more clarity, purpose, and well-being.

## What's the Big Idea?

TanOS is all about making it super easy for you to chat with your own structured self-knowledge (we call these `MEMORIES`) and your refined operational prompts (`tanos_prompts`). Add a dash of Large Language Model (LLM) smarts, and you've got a powerful partner to help you:

* **Get Clear:** Understand your thoughts, patterns, and goals better.
* **Stay Focused:** Keep track of what matters most to you.
* **Live Well:** Make decisions that align with your deepest values.

Right now, TanOS is in its early stages – a **skeletal codebase (Version 0.1.0)**. This means we've laid out the main structure and ideas, but there's still a good bit of building to do before it's a fully runnable application.

## How It's Built (The Architecture)

TanOS is designed with a few key parts working together:

* **`tanos_core/` (The Brains):** This is where the main Python magic happens. It manages your memories, handles the prompts, keeps track of the current state, talks to the LLM, and makes sure all the different modules play nicely together.
* **`tanos_data/` (Your Info Hub):** This is a placeholder for where your local data will live – things like your `MEMORIES`, the `Captain's Log` state (think of this as Nomad's daily journal), and a `Changelog` to keep track of Nomad's evolution. Ideally, this will be structured stuff like JSON, YAML, or maybe even a small SQLite database.
* **`tanos_prompts/` (The Playbook):** This holds the TanOS promptware – the refined instructions that guide Nomad's interactions.
* **`tanos_frontend_cli/` (Your First Chat Window):** This is the initial way you'll talk to TanOS – a simple Command Line Interface (CLI).
* **`tanos_frontend_web/` (The Future Look):** We're thinking ahead! This is a placeholder for a snazzy web-based interface down the road.
* **`tests/` & `scripts/`:** Places for testing the code and any helpful utility scripts.

## Getting Your Hands Dirty (Conceptual Steps for Future Devs)

So, you're interested in bringing TanOS to life? Awesome! Here's a rough idea of what that will involve:

1.  **Set Up Your Workshop:**
    * Get a Python virtual environment going.
    * Install the necessary tools: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  **Tell TanOS Where to Find Things (`tanos_core/settings.py`):**
    * Point it to your `MEMORIES` folder and your `tanos_prompts`.
    * Set up any LLM API keys or paths to local models you want to use.
    * To use OpenAI, set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and provide `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.
3.  **Get Your Data Ready:**
    * Your Markdown `MEMORIES` files will need to be converted into a structured format that the `MemoryManager` can understand (like JSON files in `tanos_data/memories/`).
    * You'll need to initialize a `captains_log_state.json` and `nomad_changelog.json`.
4.  **Talk to Nomad (via CLI):**
    * Something like this: `python -m tanos_core.main --module ChartRoom --input "Plan my week"` (Just an example!)

## What's Next on the Building List?

To get TanOS from a skeleton to a fully functioning co-pilot, we need to:

1.  **Flesh out the `tanos_core/` modules:** This is the biggest piece – writing the actual Python code that makes everything work.
2.  **Make it Robust:** Add solid error handling and good logging so we know what's happening under the hood.
3.  **Build Out the CLI:** Make the commands in `tanos_frontend_cli/commands.py` really useful.
4.  **Test, Test, Test:** Create lots of tests to make sure everything is working as expected.
5.  **Iterate with Purpose:** Use the `ArchitectOS` principles (a cool GCM-based evolution engine built into TanOS!) to refine the system based on real usage and feedback.
6.  **Dream a Little:** Start thinking about that web UI!

## Tech We're Thinking Of Using:

* **Python:** Version 3.10 or newer.
* **LLMs:** Your choice! Local ones like Ollama with `llama-cpp-python`, or API-based ones like OpenAI or Anthropic.
* **Data Storage (Local):** JSON, YAML, or maybe SQLite.
* **CLI:** The `click` or `argparse` libraries in Python are good candidates.
* **Web UI (Future):** Maybe Flask/Django with HTMX, or FastAPI with something like Svelte, Vue, or React.
* **Packing it Up (Future):** Docker could be useful for making it easy to run anywhere.
